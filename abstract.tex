In recent years, web applications have grown not only in lines of code but also in complexity. With this complexity the target surface for malicious attacks have also grown. The different layers of a web application offer different entry points for attackers. As many applications handle sensitive and confidential data, it is vital that the developers secure their code against any possible exploitation.
Therefore, automated security tools have been developed to support programmers. These security tools can be divided into three categories. First, the static analysis tools that focus on the source code and scan for vulnerabilities without actually executing the application. The dynamic analysis tools observe the application in execution. As both of those tools cannot cover all possible attack scenarios, more and more hybrid tools are introduced on the market to expand the scope of the analysis. For each category one current tool is presented.
